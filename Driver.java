/* This class emonstrates different scheduling algorithms.
 * 
 * Main() reads in the schedule of tasks (via reading the schedule.txt file)
 * and inserts each task into an ArrayList.
 * 
 * Then, it invokes the process scheduler by
 * calling the schedule() method
 * 
 * Usage:
 *  
 *  java Driver <algorithm> <scheduleFile>
 *
 * where scheduleFile is a .txt file containing a schedule of tasks
 *
 *  algorithm = {FCFS, SJF, PRI, RR, PRI-RR}
